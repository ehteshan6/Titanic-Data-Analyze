Titanic Data Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore various patterns and insights related to passenger survival. The dataset includes details like age, gender, ticket class, and fare, which are analyzed to understand their impact on survival rates.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle or similar sources.

Features
Key features in the dataset:

PassengerId – Unique ID of the passenger
Survived – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass – Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Name – Passenger name
Sex – Gender
Age – Age of the passenger
SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch – Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket – Ticket number
Fare – Fare paid
Cabin – Cabin number (if available)
Embarked – Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Requirements
Install the necessary libraries before running the analysis:


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Steps for Analysis
Load the dataset – Read the CSV file using Pandas
Data Cleaning – Handle missing values and data inconsistencies
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Generate summary statistics and visualize trends
Feature Engineering – Create new meaningful features (e.g., family size)
Data Visualization – Use Seaborn and Matplotlib for insights
Machine Learning Models (Optional) – Apply classification models to predict survival
Running the Analysis
Run the Python script:


python titanic_analysis.py
Visualizations
The analysis includes visualizations such as:

Survival rates by gender, age, and class
Correlation heatmaps
Distribution of fares and age groups
Conclusion
The project helps in understanding survival factors in the Titanic disaster. Insights from this analysis can be applied to similar real-world scenarios involving survival prediction and classification problems.
